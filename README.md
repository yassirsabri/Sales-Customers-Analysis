# Sales-Customers-Analysis
This project showcases my data analytics skills through interactive dashboards (Tableau) and predictive modeling (Python).   The goal is to analyze sales, customers, and products to extract insights and build regression models for business forecasting.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets
- `product.csv`: Product details (ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name)
- `orders.csv`: Transactions with sales, quantity, discount, profit, and shipping details
- `customers.csv`: Customer ID and names
- `location.csv`: Mapping postal codes to city, state, region, and country

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Build interactive dashboards to visualize:
   - Sales performance by product, category, and region.
   - Customer segmentation and profitability.
2. Apply regression models in Python to:
   - Predict sales based on quantity, discount, and region.
   - Estimate profit drivers.
   - Understand how discounts affect profitability.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** â†’ Dashboard creation and visualization (dashboards hosted on Tableau Public)
- **Python** â†’ Data analysis & regression modeling
- **CSV** â†’ Data source

## ðŸ“Š Dashboards
- Sales Dashboard: Revenue, profit, discount analysis by product and region.
- Customer Dashboard: Segmentation (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office), retention, and top customers.

**Tableau Links**:  
- [Sales Dashboard](your_tableau_sales_link)  
- [Customer Dashboard](your_tableau_customer_link)  

## ðŸ“ˆ Files produced
- `scripts/` containing the regression analysis script
- `notebooks/` containing Jupyter notebooks (exploration, regression, presentation)
- `outputs/` containing model artifacts, metrics, and charts
